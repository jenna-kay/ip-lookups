# ip-lookups

This parses an input file for IP addresses, and then performs GeoIP and RDAP lookups on those IPs. I developed this on MacOS Big Sur using python version 3.9.1 and tested on Windows 10 using python version 3.10. 

## Dependencies

Make sure python requests is installed. This can be done with pip.

## Running on MacOS or Linux(Ubuntu)

To run, use the command `python3 main.py` in the working directory
Note: This has only been tested on the Linux subsystem for Windows

## Running on Windows

To run in cmd, use the command `py -3.10 main.py` in the working directory
